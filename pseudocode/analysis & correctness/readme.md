## Algorithm Analysis

### Procedure: `generateTimeTable`

1. **Nested Loops**:
   - For each `period` in `Periods[p]`:
   - For each `day` in `Periods[d]`:
   - For each `class` in `c`:
   - For each `teacher` in `teachers`:

2. **Conditions**:
   - Skip iteration if `TSC = 0` for day or `remainingLectures[teacher, class] = 0`.
   - Process if specific condition `SP(teacher, class, Period[d, p])` holds true.

3. **Assignments**:
   - If `consecutiveLecture > 1` and slots are available, assign for consecutive lectures.
   - Otherwise, assign for the current lecture.

### Time Complexity Calculation:

- **Initial Complexity**: 
  - Loop complexities build as: `1 + 2p + p[1 + 2d + d[1 + 2c + c[1 + 2t + t[p + 4 + 2Si + CSi]]]]`
- **Simplified to**: 
  - Dominant term: `p^2.d.c.t`
- **Final Time Complexity**: 
  - **ùöØ(p^2.d.c.t)**, where:
    - `p`: periods/day
    - `d`: working days in a week
    - `c`: total number of classes
    - `t`: total number of teachers

### Function to Check the Correctness of Algorithm

1. **Process**:
   - For each `class` in `c` and `teacher` in `t`, verify if `remainingLectures[class][teacher]` is not zero.
   - Confirm `remaining.length = 0` to declare the process successful, otherwise unsuccessful.

2. **Time Complexity**:
   - Computed as `3c + 3.t.c`
   - Simplified to **ùöØ(t.c)**

### Supporting Procedures

- **`AssignLectureInFinal_tt`**: Assigns lecture, updates availability, and decrements `remainingLectures` (total cost: 4).
- **`SP`**: Checks if both teacher and class are available for the specified period (total cost: 3).

## Correctness

Here's how the correctness of the algorithm is ensured through loop invariants, base case, inductive case, and termination condition:

### Loop Invariant

- `remainingLectures = totalLectures - assignedLectures`

### Base Case

- At the start: No lectures assigned, `remainingLectures` is total lectures.
- After the first iteration: One lecture assigned, decrement one from `remainingLectures`.

### Inductive Case

- Assuming the algorithm holds when `k` lectures are assigned (`remainingLectures[k] = totalLectures - k`):
- After assigning `k + 1` lectures, the remaining is decremented by one:
  ```markdown
  remainingLectures[k + 1] = totalLectures - (k + 1)
  remainingLectures[k + 1] = remainingLectures[k] - 1
  ```

### Termination

- The algorithm ends when all lectures have been assigned, i.e., `remainingLectures` should be empty.
