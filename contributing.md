# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Here's how you can contribute effectively and efficiently:

### Step 1: Open an Issue
Before making any changes, please check the issue tracker to see if an existing issue addresses the change you want to make. If the issue does not exist, create a new one. This helps avoid duplicate efforts and ensures that your contribution aligns with the project's goals.

### Step 2: Fork the Repository
Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account where you can make your changes.

### Step 3: Create a New Branch
Once you've forked the repository, create a new branch for your changes. Use a clear naming convention for your branch that reflects the feature or fix you are working on, formatted as `username/feature-description`. For example, `josiahaideloje/animations`.

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes
Make your changes in your forked repository. When you're ready, commit these changes with a clear, descriptive commit message. Good commit messages provide context about what and why changes were made.

### Step 5: Submit a Pull Request
Go to your forked repository and initiate a pull request to the original repository. Make sure to reference the issue number that your pull request addresses (e.g., "Fixes #123"). This link between the pull request and the issue provides additional context and helps streamline the review process.

### Review Process
Once submitted, your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may suggest some changes, improvements, or alternatives. Some key points to remember:

- Keep pull requests small to speed up the review process.
- Include only one feature or fix per pull request.
- Follow the coding standards and documentation guidelines.
- Add or update tests as necessary.

Thank you for contributing! We're excited to review your contributions and see how your work will improve the project.
